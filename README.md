# WGAN_Generate_New_Small_Molecules
Organic molecules are important for many applications, such as drug discovery, pharmaceuticals, materials and agrochemicals. However, synthesizing new molecules manually in chemical labs is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), more specifically a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and a Vision Transformer (ViT) are employed to generate and predict new conditional organic molecules, respectively. Certain conditions, such as specifying a type of bond and element, are added to WGAN to generate only possible and correct organic compounds. As a result, we introduce our dataset, called (GenOrgo). The GenOrgo dataset consists of 400 newly generated conditional molecules, labeled into four categories, Homecycles, Heterocycles, Oxygen and Nitrogen-containing acyclics, and Hydrocarbons. Then, we evaluate the prediction performance of the ViT using the GenOrgo dataset. Attention maps are also obtained for the prediction decision. The ViT reaches a high prediction accuracy of 97\% using 5-fold cross-validation.
